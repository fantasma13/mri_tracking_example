This is sample code associated with the paper ....

This ia a wrapper around OpenCV tracking functionality to demonstrate the applicability to MRI.

This code and data are for illustration and educational purposes only. It comes as is, use at your own risk, the authors take no warranty.

The module comes in two part, the C++ code and a matlab interface. First, build the C++ interface. We used linux for
development and testing. You may have varying success when trying on other OSes. Please let me know if you make it work.

You need to have a recent copy of the following software

* cmake
* opencv >= 3
* a C/C++ compiler

First, go into src, create a build directory.

> mkdir build
> cd build
> cmake ../

Check the output and make sure all errors are corrected. Refer to cmake documentation if you have trouble finding
libraries that you know are installed.

> make 
> sudo make intall

This will put stuff in /usr/local/lib and /usr/local/bin.

Add /usr/local/lib to LD_LIBRARY_PATH in your environment.

MATLAB:

We used releases 2021B and 2023A

* OXSA is required to import DICOM images.

Prepare the C++/MATLAB interface by running in MATLAB

> mexgen_tracking
> mexgen_calcshiftvector

Try everything worked by running

> example_tracking

Troubleshooting

The Matlab C++ interface is notorious in not working. There are several important steps.

Make sure LD_LIBRARY_PATH is set correctly before starting matlab. Also, use system('ldd -d libtracking4matlab.so') to
ensure all dependencies are met. If all fails, use the binary from the command line for tracking. SVD (calcshiftvector)
ususally is simpler to make work.
